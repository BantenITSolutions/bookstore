Bookstore - Demo
================

This is a demo website illustrating the use of WordPress and the Themosis framework in order to build a custom website.

Feel free to navigate through the code. Make sure to review the code in the following directories:

1. wp-content/plugins/themosis/**app/**
2. wp-content/themes/bookstore/**app/**

**Note:** This is purely a code demo. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the use of the framework APIs. There is no complete sanitization and validation of some user inputs nor check for empty values, ...

It's also possible that you will have to run the `composer update` command inside the `plugins/themosis` directory to re-install/update the library dependency after cloning the repository on your computer.

If you have an issue with `composer`, simply delete the `vendor` directory and run the `composer install` command to install the dependency back.

### Documentation

Check the [themosis/documentation](https://github.com/themosis/documentation) repository for the APIs documentation.

###Thanks for trying out the Themosis framework.
